## Breach 10 – Brute Force Attack on Login Page

**Vulnerability:**  
The login page does not implement protection mechanisms such as rate-limiting, CAPTCHA, or account lockout, allowing brute-force attacks against user credentials.

**OWASP Top 10 Mapping:**  
**A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures**  
Failure to prevent automated attacks allows attackers to guess passwords and gain unauthorized access.

**Exploitation:**  
- Navigated to the login page:
  ```
  http://localhost:8000/?page=signin
  ```
- Used Burp Suite to intercept the login POST request.
- Sent the request to Intruder and configured a password payload using the wordlist:
  ```
  10-million-password-list-top-10000.txt
  ```
- Targeted the `admin` username with password variations from the list.
- Password match found at line 13:
  ```
  shadow
  ```
- Logged in successfully and obtained the flag.

**Prevention:**  
- Implement rate limiting and account lockout policies after several failed login attempts.
- Use CAPTCHA to prevent automated submissions.
- Enforce strong password policies and monitor for suspicious login activity.
