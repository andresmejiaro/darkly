## Breach 05 – Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Feedback Form

**Vulnerability:**  
The feedback form fails to sanitize user input, allowing raw HTML and JavaScript to be injected and executed in the browser.

**OWASP Top 10 Mapping:**  
**A03:2021 – Injection**  
This includes Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), where untrusted input is executed in the client’s browser.

**Exploitation:**  
- Navigated to the feedback page:
  ```
  http://localhost:8080/index.php?page=feedback
  ```
- Submitted the following comment:
  ```html
  <script>alert('Hi')</script>
  ```
- The page rendered the script directly, triggering an alert and revealing the flag.

**Prevention:**  
- Sanitize and encode all user input before rendering it in HTML.
- Use a templating engine or framework that automatically escapes output.
- Apply Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate script execution risks.
