## Breach 03 – Exposed Credentials and Weak Password Protection

**Vulnerability:**  
An `.htpasswd` file containing MD5-hashed credentials is exposed via a publicly accessible path. The password uses a common, unsalted MD5 hash easily cracked via rainbow tables.

**OWASP Top 10 Mapping:**  
**A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures**  
The use of unsalted MD5 for password storage is insecure and vulnerable to precomputed attacks.  
Also relevant: **A01:2021 – Broken Access Control**, due to the public exposure of the file.

**Exploitation:**  
- From the earlier `robots.txt` file, accessed:
  ```
  http://localhost:8080/whatever/
  ```
- Found an exposed `.htpasswd` file with the content:
  ```
  root:437394baff5aa33daa618be47b75cb49
  ```
- Identified the hash as unsalted MD5. Cracked it using an online hash database (hashes.com) or `john` with a wordlist:
  ```
  qwerty123@
  ```
- Performed directory fuzzing (e.g., with `gobuster`) and discovered:
  ```
  http://localhost:8080/admin/
  ```
- Used the recovered credentials to access the admin area and obtain the flag.

**Prevention:**  
- Do not expose `.htpasswd` or other credential-related files to the public.
- Use salted and slow password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
- Implement directory-level access controls and avoid relying solely on obscurity.
